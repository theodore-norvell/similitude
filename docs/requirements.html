<h2>Domain model and definitions</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Circuit Diagram</dt>
  <dd>A circuit diagram is&nbsp;a named arrangement of components and links. Copies of circuit diagrams exist on one or more clients and on the server. Each Circuit&nbsp;has a unique name.</dd>
  <dt>Component</dt>
  <dd>A&nbsp; component is an instantiaion of a component kind. Each component belongs to a single circuit.&nbsp; Each component has a number of Attributes that can be edited.(Implementation note: the state of a Component does not include any information associated with Simulations.)  </dd>
  <dt>Component kind</dt>
  <dd>A component kind defines how components appear, what attributes they have, the types of those attributes, and how the components behave during simulation. Components kinds are either&nbsp;primitive or compound.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Implementation note: in the implementation, circuit kinds have no mutable state. All mutable state&nbsp;associated is associated with the Component. The exception is for Compound Component Kind, q.v.)</dd>
  <dt>Primitive Component&nbsp;Kind</dt>
  <dd>Primitive component kinds&nbsp;are things such and gates, not&nbsp;gates, adders,&nbsp;flip-flops, that are build in.&nbsp; Primitive components also include input terminals, output terminals and </dd>
  <dt>Compound Component Kind</dt>
  <dd>Compound component kinds are little other than references to circuits. For each Circuit there is a corresponding component kind.&nbsp; When the circuit&nbsp;that a compound component refers to changes, the compound component kind changes implicitly. See discussion below: in <a href="onCompoundComponentKinds">section On Compound Component Kinds.</a> A component whose kind is a white box compound component kind&nbsp;is displayed by displaying the circuit inside the outline of the component. If c is the component and its kind's circuit is d, then c is displayed as a black rectangle and inside the rectangle the components and links of d are drawn, scaled, translated, and rotated appropriately.&nbsp; Assuming no rotation, the scaling and translating is such that the top left corner of d (d.minX, d.minY) maps to the top-left corner of c&nbsp;and the bottom right corner of d (d.maxX, d.maxY) maps to the bottom-right corner of c.&nbsp;If the orientation of c is not East, then these corners change appropriately.</dd>
  <dt>Attribute</dt>
  <dd>Attributes of components include a position (x,y), size (w, h),  orientation.  (North, South, East, West), and flip (Up or Down). Depending on the component kind, components may have other attributes. The set of Attributes that a component has and the types of those attributes is determined by the component's Kind. For example, a component whose kind is and-gate would have attribute indicating the number of inputs (a nonnegative number) and a propagation delay (a time).  A component whose kind is D-flip-flop would have a propagation time, a set-up time, and a hold-time (all of type time). A component whose component kind is compound has an attribute saying whether it is white-box or black-box (boolean).</dd>
  <dt>Port</dt>
  <dd>A Port is the representation of an input or output to a component. Each Port is associated with a component.&nbsp; Each Port is an Input Port, an Output Port, or a Bidirectional Port.&nbsp; Ports may have names.&nbsp;The number of input, output, and bidirectional ports and their names are generally determined by the component kind. For example any D-flip-flop would have two Input Ports named D and CLK and one Output Port named Q. However some Component&nbsp;Kinds will allow variable numbers&nbsp;of Input or Output Ports: for example a gate would allow a variable number of Input Ports with a minumum of 2.&nbsp; The location of a port is determined by the Kind and the Component.&nbsp;For example the Kind might determine what side a port is on. Typically the inputs are on the &quot;left&quot;, &quot;top&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot; side, while outputs are on the &quot;right&quot;. (&quot;Left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot; are assuming the orientation is the default &quot;east&quot; and the flip is the default &quot;up&quot;.) Ports may be negated or not.&nbsp; Unnegated ports are uually not drawn. (However, it might be good to draw a&nbsp;coloured square when the mouse hovers over an unnegated port.)&nbsp; Negated ports are drawn as black circles with white fill.</dd>
  <dt>Input Port</dt>
  <dd>A Port used for input.&nbsp; Input ports might be represented by small triangles&nbsp;with black stroke and white fills&nbsp;pointed into the component.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>Output Port</dt>
  <dd>A Port used for output. Output ports might be represented by small  triangles&nbsp;with black stroke and white fills&nbsp;pointed into the component.</dd>
  <dt>Bidirectional Port</dt>
  <dd>A Port used for both input and output. Bidirectional ports might be represented by small diamonds with black stroke and white fill.</dd>
  <dt>Links</dt>
  <dd>A link&nbsp;is a wire with two endpoints. The endpoints should be shown as small  squares or circles, unless the endpoint is Directly Connected to a port. The Link itself is shown as a straight  line.&nbsp; The colour of the Link and its endpoints is by default black. If there is an active Simulation the colour may be determined by the state of the Simulation. Also when the mouse hovers over an endpoint, it might be good to show it in a different colour.</dd>
  <dt>Directly Connected</dt>
  <dd>Two endpoints or an endpoint and a port may be Directly Connected. (Two ports may not be directly connected.) This is equivalence relation, i.e., it is transitive (if a~b and b~c then a~c), symmetric (if a~b then b~a), and reflexive (a~a). If two endpoints or an endpoint and a link are Directly Connected, then they will have the same location. Usually the converse is also true too. Ports can not be Directly Connected to other Ports. (Although, there could be exceptions. E.g. when we move an endpoint that is connected to a port, we would first disconnect it from the port and so for a short time, they have the same location, but are not directly connected.)</dd>
  <dt>Connection</dt>
  <dd>A&nbsp;Connection is an equivalence class of endpoints and ports that are Directly Connected. Each Connection has at least&nbsp;one port or endpoitn in it. No connection has more than one port in it. Each connection has a location. So moving one thing in the Connection will move everything in the Connection.</dd>
  <dt>Indirectly Connected</dt>
  <dd>Two ports, two links, or a port and a link are Indirectly Connected to each other if they are either Directly Connected or connected by 1 or more intermediary links.  Also every Port and Link is Indirectly Connected to itself. This is equivalence relation, i.e., it is transitive (if a~b and b~c then a~c), symmetric (if a~b then b~a), and reflexive (a~a).</dd>
  <dt>Net</dt>
  <dd>A maximal set of Ports and Links that are all connected to each other is called a Net.&nbsp; Note that each Port and Link is a member of exactly one Net. (Implementation note:&nbsp; There is no need to represent Nets explicitely. However, it will be useful for simulation if we can calculate the Net of a Port or Link.</dd>
  <dt>World coordinates</dt>
  <dd>Each Circuit is laid out on the real plane.&nbsp; Each circuit diagram has a minium and a maximum x&nbsp;and a minimum&nbsp;and maximum y, although these may change as componenst and links are added, moved, and removed.&nbsp;Let d be a Circuit and c&nbsp; is a component or link belonging to that circuit. The following invariants should be observed:
    <ul>
      <li>d.minX &lt; c.minX &lt; c.maxX &lt; d.maxX </li>
      <li>d.minY &lt; c.minY &lt; c.maxY &lt; c.maxY  </li>
    </ul>
    A world coordinate is 
  really a pair (d, (x,y)) where d is a Circuit and (x, y) is a point on the plane.</dd>
  <dt>View coordinates</dt>
  <dd>The coordinates of the canvas on which the circuit is displayed.</dd>
  <dt>Folder</dt>
  <dd>A folder is a collection of Files and Folders. Folders form a Tree such that each Folder (apart from the root) has&nbsp;a parent Folder&nbsp;and each File is in one Folder</dd>
  <dt>Home Folder</dt>
  <dd>Each User has a home folder, as does each Course.</dd>
  <dt>File</dt>
  <dd>A file is one of the following: A Saved Circuit, an Unsaved Circuit, a Saved Test, an Unsaved Test.</dd>
  <dt>abc</dt>
  <dd>def</dd>
  <dt>abc</dt>
  <dd>def</dd>

<h2>UI</h2>
<h3>Layout of the  UI</h3>
<h4>Main screen</h4>
<p>Along the top&nbsp;of the client screen is tool bar that contains buttons for the various command.</p>
<p>To the right is a tool bar (or pallette) that contains icons representing various tools. This will include tools for the most common component kinds.</p>
<p>In the middle, is the drawing canvas containing a visualization of the circuit being edited.&nbsp;Above the canvas is the name of the current circuit. The canvas is surrounded by four buttons for panning (i.e. scrolling) the canvas.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>During simulation, the bottom part of the main screen contains the simulation panel.</p>
<h3>Selection model</h3>
<p>At each point in time a set of components and links on each  diagram are considered selected. Selected components are displayed in a distinctive colour. Selected components may belong to diagrams that are inside of compound components, so it is possible that not all selected components and links belong to the same diagram.</p>
<h3>Normalization</h3>
<p>Normallization&nbsp;is a process of tidying up a cicuit diagram so that the way it is matches the way it looks. Generally normalization is done at the end of each user interaction that might change the diagram. A diagram might become denormailzed in the middle of an interaction, but at the end, it should be normal again. A normal diagram has the following properties.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any two distinct connections that are close to each other, both contain a port.</li>
  <li>Any two disctinct connections that are close to each other (and therefor both contain ports) must be connected by a link.</li>
  <li>No connection is  close to a link unless it includes an endpoint of that link.</li>
  <li>No link has two endpoints that are directly connected to each other.</li>
  <li>No two links connect the same pair of connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>A normalization process changes the diagram until it is normal. Here is a possible normalization process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>// Merge or connect connection points that are close to each other.<br>
    For all pairs of connections {c0, c1} such that c0 != c1 and c0 is close to c1
    <ol>
      <li>if  both&nbsp;c0 and c1 contain a port,
        <ol>
          <li>create a link to connect them</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>else one or both don't contain a port
        <ol>
          <li>if c0 contains a port, swap c0 and c1</li>
          <li>move everything in c0 to c1</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>// Split links if a connection point is close to the link, but not close to an endpoint.<br>
    For all connections c and for all links x not connected to c
    <ol>
      <li>If c is not close to either endpoint of x, but is close to x
        <ol>
          <li>Split x into two links each with an endpoint added to c</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>// Delete links that go nowhere
    <ol>
      <li>For all links x
        <ol>
          <li>If both endpoints are in the same connection, 
            <ol>
              <li>Mark x for deletion</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Delete all marked links</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>// Delete redundant links
    <ol>
      <li>For all remaining links x
        <ol>
          <li>If x is not marked for deletion
            <ol>
              <li>For all links y connected to x.endpoint(0) other than x
                <ol>
                  <li>If the other end of y connects to x.endpoint(1)
                    <ol>
                      <li>Mark y for deletion</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Delete all marked links</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Prenormalization: As a visual aid, when some elements of the diagram are in motion, we could highlight any connections that will be affected by normalization.&nbsp; That is any connection that is</p>
<ul>
  <li>near a link it is not connected to or</li>
  <li>near another connection when either
    <ul>
      <li>both connections contain&nbsp;a port, but there is no link between the connections,</li>
      <li>or one of the connections does not contain a port.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We move a component so that one of its ports is sufficiently close to the endpoint of a link. If the diagram is then normalized, the port and the link become connected.  </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before:&nbsp; &nbsp;{x0}-------x-------{x1}{p}</p>
    <p>After:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{x0}-------x---------{x1, p}</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>We move a component so that one of its ports is sufficiently close to the port of another component.&nbsp;If the diagram is then normalized, a link should appear connecting those ports.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before: {p}&nbsp; &nbsp; {q}</p>
    <p>After:&nbsp; &nbsp;{p,x0}--x--{x1,q}</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Suppose link x has endpoints x0 and x1,  link y has endpoints y0 and y1,  that x1 and y0 are directly connected to each other (only) and that y1 is directly connected to a port p (only). Suppose the {x1, y0} connection is moved  close to {y1, p} connection. On normalization the two connections should be merged, to create a connection {x1,y0,y1,p}. Then the y edge should be deleted.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before {x0}-------x--------{x1,y0}---y---{y1,p}</p>
    <p>After:&nbsp; {x0}-------x------------------------{x1,p}</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Suppose that p is a port and link&nbsp;y has endpoints y0 and y1.&nbsp; p is moved to be on the line between y0 and y1 (but not close to either endpoint). Then upon normalization the following could happen: First a new link z is created: z0 is connected to p, z0 is connected to y1. Second y1 is moved to connect to p. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before:&nbsp; {y0, a, b, c} ----------------y------------{y1, d, e, f}</p>
    <p>After:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {y0, a, b, c}-----y----{y1,p,z0}----z----{z1, d, e, f} </p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose that link x has&nbsp;endpoints x0 and x1 and link&nbsp;y has endpoints y0 and y1.&nbsp; x1 is moved to be on the line between y0 and y1 (but not close to either endpoint). Then upon normalization the following could happen: First a new link z is created: z0 is connected to x1, z0 is connected to y1. Second y1 is moved to connect to x1.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before:&nbsp; {y0, a, b, c} ----------------y------------{y1, d, e, f}</p>
    <p>After:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {y0, a, b, c}-----y----{y1,x1,z0}----z----{z1, d, e, f}  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Suppose a link is created that duplicates another link, then one of them will be deleted.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Add component by drag and drop</h4>
<p>Requirements: Add components to a circuit diagram.</p>
<p>Actors: The user and the client</p>
<p>Precondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Postcondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Basic Flow</p>
<ol>
  <li>User: May scroll the palette so that the appropriate item is displayed.</li>
  <li>User: Moves mouse over a palette item&nbsp;and depresses the mouse.</li>
  <li>User: Drags mouse to the drawing canvas.</li>
  <li>Client: As long as the mouse is over the palette or drawing canvas, as preview of the component is shown.</li>
  <li>User: Releases the mouse over the drawing canvas.</li>
  <li>Optionally,&nbsp;the user is asked to fill in values of any properties that are required by the kind, but that don't have default values. In particular, if the circuit is a compound circuit, the user must choose the Circuit Diagram associated with the component.</li>
  <li>Client: Adds the component to the diagram&nbsp;and then normalizes the diagram.</li>
  <li>Client: The newly added component becomes the selected component.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In step 2 the palette items should light up as the mouse passes over them.</li>
  <li>The component might actually be added to the drawing as soon as the mouse moves over the canvas.</li>
  <li>On a touch device, the drag may be done with touch event rather than mouse events.'</li>
  <li>In step 5, if the drop is on top of a compound compononent and the compound component&nbsp;is &quot;white-box&quot;, then the new component is added to the diagram associated with that compond component.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Add a new link by dragging</h4>
<p>Requirements: Add links</p>
<p>Actors: The user and the client</p>
<p>Precondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Postcondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Basic Flow</p>
<ol>
  <li>User: Depresses mouse button at a place <em>x</em> somewhere on the diagram such that it does not hit a&nbsp;selected component or link.</li>
  <li>User: Moves mouse to another part of the diagram.</li>
  <li>Client: Creates a link with disconnected endpoints y0 and y1, with y0 being at <em>x</em> (converted into world coordinates)&nbsp;and y1 at the mouse's new position (converted into world coordinates).  </li>
  <li>User continues to move the mouse.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Client: As the mouse moves, the position of y1 continues to be updated.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>User: releases the mouse or the mouse moves off the canvas</li>
  <li>Client: Normalizes the diagram.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On a touch device, touch events can be used.</li>
  <li>If <em>x</em> hits a selected component or link, then the use case for moves applies.</li>
  <li>If the original point <em>x</em> is within a compound component <em>c</em>&nbsp;(not in the current selection) and the compound component is has a white-box view, then there is an ambiguity as to whether the link should be added to the outer circuit (the circuit that the component is a part of, or the inner circuit (the circuit the component contains). The best way to decide is probably based on whether <em>x</em> is close to the edge&nbsp;of <em>c</em>. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Add to the selection or clear the selection</h4>
<p>Requirements: None</p>
<p>Actors: The user and the client</p>
<p>Precondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Postcondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Basic Flow</p>
<ol>
  <li>User: Clicks on the canvas</li>
  <li>Client: 
    <ul>
      <li>Let SL be&nbsp;the set of selected links under the mouse</li>
      <li>Let SC be the set of selected components under the mouse</li>
      <li>Let UL be the set of all other links under the mouse</li>
      <li>Let UC be the set of all other components under the mouse.</li>
      <li>If SL is not empty, remove SL from the selection.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if SC is not empty, remove SC from the selection</li>
      <li>Otherwise if UL is not empty, add UL to the selection</li>
      <li>Otherwise if UC is not empty, add UC to the selection.</li>
      <li>Otherwise all are empty: remove everything from the selection.ß</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On a touch device, touch events can be used.</li>
  <li>Disambiguating a mouse down should be done as follows: Links, then components.</li>
  <li>If the mouse hits a component or link(s) inside a compound component (in whitebox view), the inner component or link(s) is selected or deselected. But if the mouse hits only the compound component and nothing inside, the compound component is selected or deselected.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Move Selection</h4>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move components around the circuit diagram.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actors: The user and the client</p>
<p>Precondition: The client is in editing mode&nbsp;and the selection is not empty.</p>
<p>Postcondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Basic Flow</p>

  <li>User: Depresses mouse button over one or more selected components,&nbsp;but not over and selected links.</li>
  <li>Client: As the mouse moves,&nbsp;all selected  components also move. (This will automatically move all endpoints connected to ports of these components, regardless of whether the endpoint's link is selected or not.)&nbsp; All endpoints of selected links should also move unless they are directly connected to a port of a   component that is not selected.</li>
  <li>The user releases the mouse</li>
  <li>Client: Normalizes the diagram.</li>

  <li>On a touch device, touch events can be used.</li>
  <li>Disambiguating a mouse down should be done as follows: Endpoints have top priority, then links, then components.</li>
  <li>Everything that moves, moves the same amount&nbsp;in terms of world coordinates.&nbsp; (This might not make a whole lot of sense when the Selection contains things from different circuits, but I'm not concerned about that anomalous case.)</li>

<p>Basic Flow</p>
<ol>
  <li>User: Depresses mouse button over one or more endpoints of selected links</li>
  <li>Let X be the set of all endpoints that are under the mouse that are endpoints of selected links.</li>
  <li>User: Moves mouse to another part of the diagram.</li>
  <li>Client: Disconnects all the items of X. (At this point each item of X is directly connected to nothing but itself.)</li>
  <li>Client: As the mouse continues to move, all endpoints in X move along with the mouse..</li>

  <li>Disambiguating a mouse down should be done as follows: Endpoints have top priority, then links, then components.</li>
  <li>It may be that when the mouse is depressed, it is over a number of endpoints. If any of those endpoints' links are in the current selection, this use case applies, and all the endpoints whose links are in the current selection move together.</li>
  <li>Moving an endpoint or link may make new connections or break existing connections.</li>
  <li>Everything that moves, moves the same amount&nbsp;in terms of world coordinates.&nbsp; (This might not make a whole lot of sense when the Selection contains things from different circuits, but I'm not concerned about that anomalous case.)</li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3><a name="onCompoundComponentKinds"></a>On compound component kinds</h3>
<p>One issue with compound component kinds is that they must not be allowed to form a cycle. I.e. we can not add to Circuit A a Component whose Kind is a compound kind that refers directly or indirectly to Circuit A.</p>
<p>When the circuit&nbsp;that a compound component refers to changes, the compound component kind changes implicitly. For example: Suppose Circuit A contains two Components A.0&nbsp;and A.1 that are of the same Compound Component Kind&nbsp;that refers to another Circuit B.&nbsp; If B changes, then Components A.0 and A.1 may become invalid, for example the number of input and output ports that they have may need to be adjusted.&nbsp; Furthermore if the component shows a white-box view, then Circuit A will have to be re-rendered even if the attributes of its components haven't changed. From an implementation point of view, this can be accomodated by two measures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First when the Circuit is opened for editing, all its components need to be validated. Validating a component means checking that it has the right number of input ports with the right names and positions, that it has the right set of output ports with the right set of names and positions, and possibly updating attribute and their values that are derived from the kind.</li>
  <li>Second, when a Circuit is changed, any component in an open Circuit that refers to that Circuit needs to be validated.&nbsp; This can be accomplished by the observer pattern.&nbsp; For example: suppose Circuit A is open and has a component A.1 that refers to a Circuit B. A.1 observes B. Thus when B is changes, it notifies A.1 which then validates itself.&nbsp;Whether or not&nbsp;A.1 was invalid, the change to B is a change to A and so A notifies its observers that it has changed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On client copies and server copies</h2>
<p>Note that while Circuits  are stored on the server, a client may obtain a copy of a Circuit for editing&nbsp;or simulation. We need to avoid the&nbsp;problem that two clients might try to edit the same circuit at the same time.&nbsp; Conflicting edits must be resolved in some way. The simplest way to resolve conflicts is that the most recent update prevails, even if it overwrites changes from another client.&nbsp; <a href="concurrentEditing.html">Elsewhere</a>&nbsp;I'll discuss a scheme that allows concurrent editing.</p>
